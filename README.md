# micrometer-pekko

This project is a fork of an early version of [Kamon-Akka](https://kamon.io/docs/latest/instrumentation/akka/). The Kamon team have done a great job and if you are just experimenting with metrics collection, then their tools and documentation are a great starting point. 
This fork produces metrics in [Micrometer](http://micrometer.io/) format.

These are 2 previous iterations of this library:
* [Prometheus-Akka](https://github.com/Workday/prometheus-akka)
* [Kontainers/micrometer-akka](https://github.com/Kontainers/micrometer-akka) - this does not support Scala 3 but does have
releases that support older versions of Akka and/or Scala 

Differences from Kamon-Akka:
- we do not support Kamon TraceContexts, as we currently have no use case for them
- we support Scala 2.12, Scala 2.13 and Scala 3.1
- we only support Akka 2.6
- records time in seconds as opposed to nanoseconds (the data is still a double)

```sbt
"com.github.pjfanning" %% "micrometer-akka" % "0.13.3"
```

There is a sample project at https://github.com/pjfanning/micrometer-akka-sample

## Usage

To enable monitoring, include the appropriate jar as a dependency and include the following Java runtime flag in your Java startup command (aspectjweaver is a transitive dependency of micrometer-akka):

-javaagent:/path/to/aspectjweaver-1.9.9.1.jar

You will also need to set up the Micrometer Meter Registry.

com.github.pjfanning.micrometer.akka.AkkaMetricRegistry#setRegistry ([example](https://github.com/pjfanning/micrometer-akka-sample/blob/main/src/main/scala/com/example/akka/Main.scala))

## Configuration

The metrics are configured using [application.conf](https://github.com/typesafehub/config) files. There is a default [reference.conf](https://github.com/pjfanning/micrometer-akka/blob/main/src/main/resources/reference.conf) that enables only some metrics.

### Metrics

#### Dispatcher

- differs a little between ForkJoin dispatchers and ThreadPool dispatchers
- ForkJoin: parallelism, activeThreadCount, runningThreadCount, queuedSubmissionCount, queuedTaskCountGauge stealCount
- ThreadPool: activeThreadCount, corePoolSize, currentPoolSize, largestPoolSize, maxPoolSize, completedTaskCount, totalTaskCount

#### Actor System

- Actor Count
- Unhandled Message Count
- Dead Letter Count

#### Actor

- One metric per actor instance
- mailboxSize (current size), processingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count

#### Actor Router

- One metric per router instance, summed across all routee actors
- routingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count

#### Actor Group

- Each actor group has its own include/exclude rules and you can define many groups with individual actors being allowed to be included in many groups - the metrics are summed across all actors in the group
- actorCount (current active actors), mailboxSize (current size), processingTime, timeInMailbox, message count, error count
